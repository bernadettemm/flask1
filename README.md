# Flask Application for learning and skill development

## Simple changelog
The following are a list of files with the changes
### app.py
I have commented out a few lines especially the import which was causing the errors 


### base.html
Importing of the css file had an error due to using css and not CSS ie mixing capital and small letters
NB: a good naming convetion for folders is that they should all be in small letters
